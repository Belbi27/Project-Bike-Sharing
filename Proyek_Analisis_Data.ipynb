        "- Conclusion to question 1 : Weather conditions have a big influence on the average bicycle rental rate. On average the most bicycle rentals occur when the weather is Clear with a total of almost 5000 renters. When the weather is misty there are around 4000 people who rent bicycles. The lowest total rentals occur when the weather is Light Snow, Light Rain only reached around 2000. This is because when the weather is clear, people are more likely to be outdoors and choose to rent bicycles, when the weather is light rain and snow many people choose to stay and not be outside. When the weather is rainy and snowy, people choose not to be outdoors, therefore no one rents bicycles\n",
        "\n",
        "- Conclusion to question 2 : On weekends the most rentals are in the fall season with a total of around 5500 and the least are in the spring season with a total of approximately 2500. On weekdays the most rentals are in the fall season with a total of almost more than 5500 and the least are in the spring season with the total is approximately 3000. Each season on weekdays has a greater total number of rentals than on weekends. However, in the summer season the total number of bicycle rentals is greater on weekends than weekdays. This is because in the summer season usually many people are on summer vacation and this is what makes the summer season have high total rentals on weekends.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Conclusion to question 3 : Bicycle rental orders increased from 2011 to 2012. In 2011 the most rentals occurred in June with a total of approximately 5000 orders, while the least occurred in January with a total of around 1000 orders. in 2012 the most rentals occurred in September with a total of more than 7000 orders, while the least occurred in January with a total of around 3000 orders"
